# VR_Music_Visualizer :notes:
A music visualizer based on particle interactions built for Google Cardboard.

This project was created by Marie Urmano, Jesse Trinity, and Chaz Pearson for Benjamin Lok's Spring 2016 Virtual Reality course as Project 3 Data Visualization.


## Link to a .zip of your code and executable (executable for the mobile device):



## YouTube Video:
Video of the 3+ minute experience followed by insight goals, the benefits of experiencing the environment in VR, and a technical description of your system.

##Insights Participants Will Gain:
Participants will (1) identify key components that play into sound systems and (2) learn how bands of sound interact to form sound waves and speech. They will be able to interact with the waves by changing amplitude, wave speed, and wave color to better understand sound wave movement and gain an understanding of the visualization. In addition, the user will also have the opportunity to hear the course of an audio source manipulating the wave, as an addition to recognizing and decoding sound waves that make up speech in the original scene.

##For each participant, have them write down what they know about the topic contained in the VR experience.

###Participant 1:
"I do not know how waves interact together to form sound systems."

Insights Gained:
"I liked how it looked visually. I understand a little better how waves can work together as a whole to form speech or simulate a song."

###Participant 2:
"I honestly don't know much about sound and waves."

Insights Gained:
"It looked really cool to walk inside and look at the simulation from a different perspective. I could see the waves changing in response to the sound intensity."

###Participant 3:
"I know that different frequencies of sound and amplitudes can effect sound volumes."

Insights Gained:
"I really liked how the simulation modeled the sound from my voice. It showed how my voice can be separated into different components."

## In your report, discuss whether your predictions were accurate. Why or why not.

Our predictions, though a little too positive on the outlook, did model the participant's responses to their insights gained. It was often seen as a very pretty tool that was addicting to watch, but the interactions and changing of components on the experience were what really contributed to it being a learning tool as well. As a result, this visualizer did provide significant insights and also an aesthetic that is supported through virtual reality and a first person perspective.

## Have three people rate simulator sickness after the experience. Report averages and discuss what factors resulted in the simulator sickness values reported.

Our three people gained the following scores:
6, 12, 11.
Average: 9.66

###How different components of the experience impacted the reported simulator sickness:

This virtual reality simulation, in its nature, shows many moving particles and ways for the user to get dizzy or eye strains. However, in order to visualize sound waves, the particles did a great job in showing a scene that was very accurate and real to show true data visualization. The depth into how close the user was to the waves definitely impacted the simulation, as well as the fast motion of the music or speech that was picked up. As a result, though these components definitely contributed to a higher simulation sickness score, they still provided a learning objective and an awesome way for the user to experience modeled data.

## Identify how the experience leveraged concepts found in the VR Book sections Chapter 19.

Email TAs 1) your opinion of the grades for each element in the rubric and 2) divide up 100 points of effort amongst the members (this will be kept deidentified, but will factor into grade)
